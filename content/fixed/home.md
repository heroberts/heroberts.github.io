  I am a postdoctoral researcher working on the "Dynamic Urban Environmental Exposures on Depression and 
  Suicide", or "NEEDS" project. Specifically I work on WP2, which examines the association between 
  depression and the environment along people's daily space-time paths. More information on this project 
  is available [here](http://needs.sites.uu.nl/).

  Prior to starting this position I completed my PhD at the University of Leeds (UK) and Born in Bradford 
  (Bradford Institute for Health Research). My thesis was titled: "Development and evaluation of 
  environmental interventions on green space utilisation to promote health and well-being". 
  The overall aim of the thesis was to provide evidence to inform the design of an environmental 
  intervention into green space use in order to promote health. It is openly accessible online 
  [here](http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/19839).
