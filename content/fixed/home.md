Hi! I am  a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Human Geography and Spatial Planning, Utrecht Unviersity. I work on the "NEEDS" project (Dy*n*amic Urban *E*nvironmental *E*xposures on *D*epression and *S*uicide). More specifically, I examine the association between depression and the environment along people's daily space-time paths. More information on the project is available [here](http://needs.sites.uu.nl/).

I can be contacted at h.e.roberts [at] uu [dot] nl.
