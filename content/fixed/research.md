I am currently a postdoctoral researcher working on the "Dynamic Urban Environmental Exposures on Depression and Suicide", or "NEEDS" project. Specifically I work on WP2, which examines the association between depression and the environment along people's daily space-time paths. More information on this project is available [here](http://needs.sites.uu.nl/).

Prior to starting this position I completed my PhD at the University of Leeds (UK) and Born in Bradford (Bradford Institute for Health Research). My thesis was titled: "Development and evaluation of environmental interventions on green space utilisation to promote health and well-being". The overall aim of the thesis was to provide evidence to inform the design of an environmental intervention into green space use in order to promote health. It is openly accessible online [here](http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/19839/).
